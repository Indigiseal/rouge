# Project rails (follow these)
- Engine: Phaser 3.
- Board code: src/cardSystem.js (donâ€™t rename public APIs or save fields).
- When creating TODO.md:
  - Sections: Now / Next / Later
  - Each task must include:
    - Files touched
    - Acceptance criteria (bullet list)
    - How to test (one line)
- Prefer minimal patches, no massive rewrites.
